# DAO Architecture with CRUD Operations  

This project demonstrates a **basic DAO (Data Access Object) architecture** for managing database operations efficiently. It follows the **separation of concerns** principle, making the application modular and maintainable.  

## **Features**  
- Implements **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**.  
- Uses **JDBC** for database interaction.  
- Follows the **DAO design pattern** for structured data handling.  
- Provides a clean and scalable approach to database operations.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Java**  
- **JDBC**  
- **MySQL**  
- **DAO Pattern**  

## **Project Structure**  
- `model/` → Entity classes.  
- `dao/` → DAO classes for database interaction.  
- `service/` → Business logic.  
- `controller/` → Manages user interaction.  

## **Setup Instructions**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```  
2. Configure database credentials in the DAO class or properties file.  
3. Run the application and perform CRUD operations.
